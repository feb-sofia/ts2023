# Stochastic Processes

## Why is Time Series Analysis Different

```{r, warning=FALSE}
n <- 10
B <- 5
set.seed(21)

dt_rw <- tibble(
  r = rep(1:B, n),
  e = rnorm(n = B*n)
) %>%
  group_by(r) %>%
  mutate(
    t = 1:n,
    x = cumsum(e),
    is_observed = (r == 1),
  )

dt_rw %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = t,
      y = x, 
      group = r, 
      alpha = factor(is_observed))
    ) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    alpha = "Observed"
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:n)
```



We view the observed time series of length $T$ as a realization of $T$ random
variables. The observed values of the process is what we call a time series (XXX, w).

## Stocahstic Process

A stochastic process in the context of time series analysis is a sequence of random variables $\{x_t\}$ indexed by some notion of time (XXX, w!) (second, minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter, year, etc.).
