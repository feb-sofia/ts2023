## Grading

The course consists of two parts: lectures and exercise classes. Your final grade will be the average of the grades of these two parts. To obtain a grade for the exercise classes, you need to complete a homework project at the end of the semesterâ€”details to be announced.

## Software Setup

The exercise classes require a minimal software setup:

1. Open <https://cran.r-project.org/>, and you will find links to R builds for different operating systems. Click on the link matching your operating system and choose the latest version of R. When using the Windows operating system, you will see a link "Install R for the first time ." Click on this link and then download the R installer. Run the installer and accept the default settings.

2. After installing R, open <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>. If the web page recognizes your operating system, you will see a download button (right side of the page) for R studio. If the button does not appear, scroll down the page and find the installer appropriate for your operating system. 

3. Should you encounter difficulties installing R and R Studio, you can watch
these video guides:

5. Open R Studio and open a new project dialog: File -> New Project. In the 
dialog, click on the third option: version control. From the next menu, select git.

6. In the exercise classes, we will use many functions from the `tidyverse` system and several other packages. Before accessing these packages' functionality, you need to install them first. Find the R console in R studio and paste the following line on the command line. Press enter to run it and wait for the installation to complete.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "tidyverts", "xts", "quantmod", "urca"))
```
